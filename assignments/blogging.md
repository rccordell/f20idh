## Overview

+ A growing portfolio of short-format scholarly writing, added to your personal website

+ Six posts contributed through the semester, with *at least two* published before mid-term
+ Posts of ~750-1500 words length
+ Posts published *at least* one week apart

## The Nitty-Gritty

Scholars in a field called “digital humanities” are, perhaps not surprisingly, often very active online. Many share their scholarship through blogs or social networking sites. [Digital Humanities Now](https://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/), for instance, surfaces exciting new content from the field from its [list of subscribed feeds](https://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/subscribed-feeds/). DHNow is based on a “post-publication” model of peer review, in which scholarship is first published on blogs and is then certified based on its circulation and commentary within the scholarly community. This assignment asks you to begin building your own scholarly presence online so you can participate in those conversations.

I have three primary goals in asking you to build your own website:

1. Becoming facile with web publication is a good first step toward gaining skills you could use learning more advanced digital humanities tools and platforms.
2. Having your own website provides you a platform to begin doing and sharing that work with others in the academic and professional communities.
3. Having your own website will enable you to complete your [blogging assignment](/assignments/blogging.html) for this class while beginning while building a portfolio of work for use after and outside this class.
4. Finally, I believe it’s important for you to have a voice on the web that’s yours, something beyond content you contribute freely to whatever commercial platforms are currently popular (though those platforms have their place). By the end of the semester you may agree with me about this or disagree, but I would like you to experiment with having a domain of your own, at least for a little while.

I’m asking you to build your own website as a chance to write yourself into the digital humanities world. Deciding how to rhetorically position yourself in relation to your studies and your career goals is important. This is a chance to take a first stab at this process and why I’m asking that you consider buying a domain name that is somehow related to your own name, though this is by no means required. Indeed, many DH scholars are known just as readily by their monikers (@readywriting, @wykenhimself, @samplereality) as by their actual names. If you prefer to blog for this class anonymously, you may—so long as I know which domain is yours.

We will work on the basics of this assignment together in the first 2-3 labs of the term. There are many means and platforms for creating a website, but we will be using a combination of Markdown, Jekyll, and GitHub pages. Don't worry if those words don't mean anything to you right now; we will cover them all in detail together.

### Flexibility

"Intro to DH" is a challenging and full class. The semester will include thirteen weeks of readings and eleven or twelve labs. To give you some flexibility, you may choose six weeks during which to blog. I strongly recommend you not delay starting this work, but instead begin early and work steadily so that you can use this flexibility as the inevitable stresses of the semester emerge. To that end, *at least two posts* must be finished before mid-term, and I would strongly urge to to strive for three before mid-term.
