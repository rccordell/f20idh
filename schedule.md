## Schedule Notes

All readings are available online, some through direct links and some in our [class Leganto list](https://northeastern.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01NEU_INST/lists/10850708140001401?auth=SAML). If there's not a direct link in the schedule below, check Leganto to see if the reading is there. You will need to log in to Leganto using your NU credentials. 

### On Readings:

Each week there are readings listed under *Core* and *Penumbra*. The core readings are just that: central to the week's discussion and lab. Everyone should read these closely and prepare to discuss them. The penumbral readings include some of the many brilliant pertinent readings I could not require because time is, sadly, finite. If at all possible, I encourage you to choose one of the penumbral readings each week, based on your own interests, to read closely and be prepared to discuss in class. 

In the week you lead class you should prepare all of the core and penumbral readings, and if you choose to dig into one of these topics for an assignment the penumbral readings are the first place you might turn to begin expanding your thinking.
