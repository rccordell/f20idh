## Schedule Notes

### On Readings:

Each week there are readings listed under *Core* and *Penumbra*. The core readings are just that: central to the week's discussion and lab. Everyone should read these closely and prepare to discuss them. The penumbral readings include some of the many brilliant pertinent readings I could not require because time is, sadly, finite. If at all possible, I encourage you to choose one of the penumbral readings each week, based on your own interests, to read closely and be prepared to discuss in class. 

In the week you lead class you should prepare all of the core and penumbral readings, and if you choose to dig into one of these topics for an assignment the penumbral readings are the first place you might turn to begin expanding your thinking.

### On Project Reviews

Most weeks the schedule also points to a set of digital humanities projects: sometimes through a list and sometimes by pointing you toward an existing journal or directory that itself lists projects. I do not expect you to spend hours combing through these projects one-by-one, though of course you may if one really catches your interest. Instead, I ask you to do some meaningful browsing, clicking through to get a sense of the projects. What are the project team's intellectual aims and research questions? What methods, computational or otherwise, do they employ? What technologies do they use? Take notes as you go and think about what project you might want to dig into further, whether it's one that's assigned or another you hear about during our discussions.
